# What's for dinner?

This repository contains code of a simple Android application which uses Room Database.

Its main purpose was to help with choosing, well, what's for dinner.

It allows the user to add new dishes and store a list of them. Each dish has a name and a type. The user might then ask the app to pick a random dish of a chosen type (or just a random dish). The newest version also allows the user to delete the chosen dish.

The app is currently developed, so more features and new designs are expected to be added in the future.
